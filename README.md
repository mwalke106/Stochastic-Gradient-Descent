Intro to Machine Learning - Stochastic Gradient Descent Implementation

hw1_4c
Implementation of stochastic gradient descent on training data from sgd_data.csv. This training data consists of an X vector of length 4 and the corresponding y values. The final weight vector W was calculated to be [-0.227, -5.931, 3.930, -11.685, 8.749]

hw1_4d
Visualization of how the error varies with the epoch number, given different learning rates in an SGD implememtation. The final plot can be seen in the errors vs epoch image.
